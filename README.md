# Insights from the 8th European Social Survey

In this **full-stack data science project**, I will analyze the 8th European Social Survey. 

> *How do the citizens of European countries think about certain social issues? What about climate change, politics, immigration, individual well-being? How do people's opinions and beliefs differ within a country or among the countries?*

I attempt to answer these question here. After a contextual introduction, we will start with **data selection and cleaning**, followed by interactive **visualization and exploration**. In the second half of the project, we will gain deeper insights by employing **statistical inference** and **machine learning** methods and discuss their validity and interpretability.

The whole project is contained in this [Jupyter notebook](./insights-from-the-european-social-survey-8.ipynb). The interactive visualization uses Java Script which cannot be rendered here on GitHub - please view the notebook [here on Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Pascal-Bliem/european-social-survey/blob/master/insights-from-the-european-social-survey-8.ipynb).
